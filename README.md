_**Project created following the lessons of the Angular course of [Develhope](https://develhope.co)- Prof. Sciuti**_

In this project we have created a single page application in Angular for project management. It is possible to insert a new project, modify and view it.

Main topics covered:
* Components and modules
* Forms
* @Input and @Output
* Routing
* Services
* RxJS
* API

**N.B.** The project follows the course step by step. To facilitate consultation and as the code varies over time, the naming of the commits follows the title of the lessons.
